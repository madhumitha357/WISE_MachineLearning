It is implemented in C and Fortran so when calculations are vectorized (formulated with vectors and matrices), the performance is very good.\n","\n","It offers ndarray data structure for storing and ufuncs for efficiently processing the (homogeneous) data. Some of the important functionalities include: basic slicing, advanced or fancy indexing, broadcasting, etc.\n","\n","\n","**How are NumPy arrays different from Python lists?**\n","\n","* Python lists are very general. They can contain any kind of object. They are dynamically typed.\n","* They do not support mathematical functions such as matrix and dot multiplications, etc. Implementing such functions for Python lists would not be very efficient because of the dynamic typing.\n","* Numpy arrays are statically typed and homogeneous. The type of the elements is determined when the array is created.\n","* Numpy arrays are memory efficient.\n","* Because of the static typing, fast implementation of mathematical functions such as multiplication and addition of numpy arrays can be implemented in a compiled language (C and Fortran is used).\n","\n","\n","Now it is time to work on practicals.
